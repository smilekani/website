<h2 class="text-center">Git Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p class="text-center">Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development,but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
       
     <br><p class="text-center">Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.</p>
    <br><p class="text-center">As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server</p>
    <br><p class="text-center">Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.</p>
