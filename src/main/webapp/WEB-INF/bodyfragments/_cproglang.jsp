<h2 class="text-center">What is a C Programming?</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p class="text-center">The C programming language is a structure oriented programming language, developed at Bell Laboratories in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.</p>
    <br><p class="text-center">C programming language features were derived from an earlier language called “B” (Basic Combined Programming Language – BCPL)</p>
    <br><p class="text-center">C language was invented for implementing UNIX operating system</p>
    <br><p class="text-center">In 1978, Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan published the first edition “The C Programming Language” and commonly known as K&R C</p>

    <br><p class="text-center">Features of C programming language:

C language is one of the powerful language. Below are some of the features of C language.

    Reliability
    Portability
    Flexibility
    Interactivity
    Modularity
    Efficiency and Effectiveness
    </p>
    <br><p class="text-center">
    Uses of C programming language:

The C programming language is used for developing system applications that forms a major portion of operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux. Below are some examples of C being used.

    Database systems
    Graphics packages
    Word processors
    Spreadsheets
    Operating system development
    Compilers and Assemblers
    Network drivers
    Interpreters
    </p>
    <br><p class="text-center">
    Which level is C language belonging to?

There are 3 levels of programming languages. They are,

    Middle Level languages:
    Middle level languages don’t provide all the built-in functions found in high level languages, but provides all building blocks that we need to produce the result we want. Examples: C, C++
    High Level languages:
    High level languages provide almost everything that the programmer might need to do as already built into the language. Example: Java, Python
    Low Level languages:
    Low level languages provides nothing other than access to the machines basic instruction set. Example: Assembler
    </p>
    <br><p class="text-center">C language is a structured language:

Structure oriented language:

    In this type of language, large programs are divided into small programs called functions
    Prime focus is on functions and procedures that operate on the data
    Data moves freely around the systems from one function to another
    Program structure follows “Top Down Approach”
    Examples: C, Pascal, ALGOL and Modula-2

Object oriented language:

    In this type of language, programs are divided into objects
    Prime focus is in the data that is being operated and not on the functions or procedures
    Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external functions
    Program structure follows “Bottom UP Approach”
    Examples: C++, JAVA and C# (C sharp)

Non structure oriented language:

    There is no specific structure for programming this language. Examples: BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN
    </p>
    
    <br><p class="text-center">Key points to remember in C language:

    The C language is a structure oriented programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie.
    The C language is belonging to middle level programming language.
    Operating system programs such as Windows, Unix, Linux are written in C language.
    C89/C90 and C99 are two standardized editions of C language.
    C has been written in assembly language.
